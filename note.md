#Flude  
 ### To allow webpage to adapt the current viewport.

 Use % (or vw)unit instead of px for elements that should adapt to viewport( usually layout
 )
 Use max-width instead of width 


 ###  layout 

 float layouts: the old ways of building layouts  
 flexbox
 css grid 

 # Responsive unites
 use rem unit instead of px for most lengths 
 
 To make it easy to scale the entire layout down( or up) automatially 

 # Flexible images

 By default, images don't scale automatially as we change the viewport so we need to fix that. 
 Always use % for image dimesnionns, together with the max-width property. 


 # Media queries 
To change css styles on certian viewport widths ( called breakpoint)
